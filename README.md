## FIND A FAMILIAR âœ¨ðŸ’«

Find A Familiar is an app designed for witches looking for a familiar to help them with their magicks. The app is a single page vanilla javascript frontend, with a rails backend. Users first select the type of animal they would like as a familar. This leads you to all of the available cats, dogs, owls, and rats. Clicking on a specific animal will let you see details and reviews. Beware! Some animals are too clever and magical for their own good.
